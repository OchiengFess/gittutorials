# ML-Based Credit Scoring for Government Loans

## Overview
This repository contains the code and documentation for the **ML-Based Credit Scoring for Government Loans** project. The project aims to enhance the efficiency and fairness of government-backed loan programs by developing a machine learning (ML) model that predicts loan repayment likelihood. The solution ensures optimized allocation of funds to individuals and businesses with the highest potential for success, aligning with the mission of promoting economic empowerment and sustainable fiscal practices.

## Features
- **Data Analysis**: Exploration of applicants' financial history, demographics, and economic conditions.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Implementation of algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Random Forests, and Gradient Boosting.
- **Performance Monitoring**: Evaluation using KPIs like default rates and repayment timeliness.
- **Visualization**: Interactive dashboards for stakeholders to understand model outcomes.

## Project Objectives
1. **Increase Efficiency**: Streamline loan processing and risk assessment.
2. **Promote Fairness**: Support financial inclusion for underserved populations.
3. **Optimize Portfolios**: Reduce default risks and improve loan program sustainability.

## Project Workflow
1. **Data Collection**: Assemble data on loan applicants, including financial, demographic, and economic metrics.
2. **Preprocessing**: Clean, encode, and prepare data for ML modeling.
3. **Model Development**: Train and evaluate multiple ML algorithms.
4. **Evaluation**: Monitor and refine model performance using KPIs.
5. **Deployment**: Develop interactive dashboards for stakeholders.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: For data analysis and ML development.
- **Machine Learning Libraries**: Scikit-learn, XGBoost.
- **Visualization Tools**: Plotly, Dash.
- **Version Control**: Git and GitHub.
